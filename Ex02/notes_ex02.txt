# Getting started with Quantum Espresso
######

- clone the git repository of the course: git clone https://github.com/timwehlinghh/CMS_UHH24.git
- load Quantum Espresso: module load quantum-espresso/7.3.1-studix
- cast module path to module bin into variable: QE_PATH=//opt/sw/quantum_espresso/7.3.1-studix/bin/
  (Thanks for the reminder about // ;D )
- call of executables via $QE_PATH/pw.x; bands.x and dos.x

- run scf calcutions: $QE_PATH/pw.x < scf.in > scf.out &
	- nscf.in and bscf.in can be run in the same way
	- the bracket < defines the input file and > defines which file to write to
- run bands extraction: $QE_PATH/bands.x < bands.in > bands.out
- run DOS extraction: $QE_PATH/dos.x < dos.in > dos.out

- data on the bands is for instance stored in files ending in .gnu as a two-column structure;
  the first column repeats the distance in reciprocal space along the chosen k-path;
  the second column contains the energies of the bands
- data on the DOS is stored files ending in .dos with a header telling you that the columns contain
  the energy, the DOS and the integrated DOS

# Analysis
######
- You are free to choose whether you want to analyse the data directly via execution of python
  scripts or copy the necessary data to your PC locally
