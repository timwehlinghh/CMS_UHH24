This time around, in addition to pw.x for running (n)SCF calculations, you need pw2wannier90.x and wannier90.x
Calculations need ...
... a postprocessing of nSCF by Wannier90 (note that the file here has no extension)
wannier90.x -pp C_<...> 
... the calculation of M and A matrices
pw2wannier90.x < pw2wann_<...>.in > pw2wann_<...>.out
... the run of the Wannier construction
wannier90.x C_<...>
